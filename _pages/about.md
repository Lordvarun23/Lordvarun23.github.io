# About Me

Hi, I’m **Varun Sampath Kumar**, a first-year **PhD student** at the **Applied AI and Data Science Unit, The Maersk Mc-Kinney Møller Institute**, **University of Southern Denmark (SDU)**. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Vinay Chakravarthi Gogineni](https://vinaychakravarthi.github.io/) and [Dr. Esmaeil S. Nadimi](https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/esmaeil-nadimi/).

I completed my **Integrated M.Sc. (B.Sc. + M.Sc.) in Data Science** at **PSG College of Technology** (an autonomous institution under Anna University) in **June 2025**. During my undergraduate studies, I interned at **KLA** for 15 months, where I worked on **self-supervised learning for wafer defect classification** and contributed to **data engineering pipelines** involving **Apache Iceberg, DuckDB, and PySpark**. I also had the opportunity to collaborate with Dr. Poonthalir G on **Federated Learning.**.

My current research focuses on developing **novel machine unlearning algorithms** for both **vision (discriminative and generative) models** and **large language models (LLMs)**. In particular, I aim to design **computationally efficient and retain data-free unlearning paradigms** that can handle real-world complexities and scalability challenges.

Beyond unlearning, I am deeply interested in the **memorization and generalization theory of deep neural networks**, **model compression**, and **mechanistic interpretability**. My long-term goal is to contribute to building frameworks that enable AI systems to **comply with emerging AI regulations** while maintaining a balance between **efficiency and efficacy**.
